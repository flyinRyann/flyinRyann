### Xin chào các lập trình viên 👋!
Hi there, my name is Ryan, I'm a Vietnamese/Australian programmer. I'm currently a 3rd year university student from Monash University, Clayton Campus. I am studying a double degree of Bachelor of Electrical and Computer Systems and Bachelor of Computer Science majoring in Advanced Computer Science. I'm passionate about robotics, football, and programming. <br>

I create videos and try to program some fun projects in my spare time outside of university. My dream job is to be an electrical or software engineer at a company that creates global change or have major impact on our everyday lives. <br>

My technical skills include coding in JS, Python, MIPS, Verilog, Java, HTML, CSS and many other languages.
