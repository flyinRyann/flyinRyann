### Xin chào các lập trình viên 👋!
Hi there, my name is Ryan, I'm a programmer. I'm a final-year CS student from Monash University, Clayton Campus. My major is Advanced Computer Science which has a strong focus on Algorithms. I'm passionate about robotics, football, and programming. <br>

My technical skills include coding in JS, Python, MIPS, Verilog, Java, HTML, CSS and many other languages.
